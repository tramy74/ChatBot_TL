Wildlife Filmmakers 
 
Richard and Sonia Muller make documentaries about wildlife, particularly 
dangerous animals, like the big cats found in Africa. Film-making for 
them is a way to bring the message of the importance of understanding 
wildlife to international audiences, with their last film, Staying 
Alive, exploring relationships between lions and other wildlife in one 
African region.  When Richard and Sonia were invited to help with a 
special project run by a wildlife organisation that was providing 
information about the falling numbers of big cats, especially lions, 
they immediately agreed to take part. 
 
Richard grew up near a wildlife park and as a child was keen on filming 
what he saw. The couple were introduced at university in Cape Town, and 
quickly realised how much they had in common. They were both curious 
about the natural world and Sonia soon discovered a similar talent for 
filmmaking. As a child in South Africa Sonia often ran off alone to 
explore the wild areas surrounding her home, despite her parents’ fears. 
 
When asked what they found hardest about their work, Sonia and Richard 
have the same answer - leaving an area and finishing a project. Sonia 
adds that the hours required can be hard, and things like the heat, 
dust, and bugs make it very tiring. The excitement of her work comes 
from not knowing what will happen, perhaps even discovering something 
new for science, while Richard takes most interest in spending time with 
individual animals, getting to know their character. 
 
The pair visit schools around the world, and notice that students with 
access to lots of information don’t always have as much understanding about 
geography as students in countries where access is limited.  “Students 
without the internet constantly available actually look at maps, they want 
to find out where they are and often end up with a better idea of place,” 
Richard says. A major part of their work is explaining to students the 
importance of a fuller understanding of various environments by studying 
the climate, animals and culture of a specific location. 
 
If you’d like a similar career, Richard suggests studying various 
different areas of biology, rather than learning about the latest film-
making technology, as an understanding of the natural world will last 
forever. The couple also give general advice for those wanting to help 
protect the environment. Sonia explains that it’s important to allow 
yourself to concentrate. “Turning off personal electronic items gets you 
closer to the natural world,” she says. “You can watch nature, instead 
of listening for your mobile phone.” Most importantly they agree that if 
urgent action isn’t taken, more animals might be lost. However, the fact 
that more teenagers are getting involved offers some hope for the 
future.

My Job at a Summer Camp, by Charlie Rose 
 
Every year I work at a summer camp for kids and I really enjoy seeing the children do things they 
never thought they could do. Nearly all the kids know how to swim and play table-tennis before they 
come, but things like rock climbing are new experiences for most. Some of them are very nervous, 
but after a bit of encouragement, they agree to try and they all get to the top in the end, which makes 
them feel great.  
 
The kids stay several weeks and some do miss home. You might expect it to be the really young ones 
who feel like that the most but it’s actually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We don’t let them use their 
mobile phones all the time. First we tell them they can phone home after lunch. Then when they ask 
again, usually after dinner, we say it’s a bit too late to phone and suggest doing it the next day. Most 
children are fine in a couple of days and at the end of their stay, it’s amazing how many come and 
thanks us because they have had a great time.  
 
It’s not just the children who get lonely. We get parents who are on the phone the whole time, asking 
how their child is getting on, which is quite unnecessary. Often their son or daughter will be busy, 
playing games or doing something else, so we have to tell parents to ring back another time.  
 
Some kids arrive dressed in smart, designer, new clothes and they sometimes argue when we tell 
them to change into something they won’t mind getting dirty, but before long they realise what we 
mean.
